# N-Queens
Description of the N-Queens Problem
The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial puzzle that requires placing N queens on an N Ã— N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. A queen in chess can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, making the placement challenging.

Problem Constraints:
Each row must contain exactly one queen.
Each column must contain exactly one queen.
No two queens should share the same diagonal.
Since queens can attack in all directions, ensuring a conflict-free placement is a complex task.
